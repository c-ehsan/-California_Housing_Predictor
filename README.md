# 🏠 California Housing Price Predictor  

> **An interactive Machine Learning web app that predicts California house prices based on real-world census data.**  
> Built with ❤️ using Python, scikit-learn, and Streamlit.  

---

## 🚀 Overview  
This project uses a **Random Forest Regressor** trained on the **California Housing Dataset** to predict median house values.  
The app lets users input key features (like income, rooms, and population) and instantly get an estimated house price.  

🧠 **Model Performance:**  
- ✅ Algorithm: Random Forest Regressor  
- ✅ R² Score: **0.70**  
- ✅ MSE: 3.79e+09  
- ✅ Feature Importance: `median_income` had the highest impact (~0.5)

- Real-time price prediction  
- Interactive web interface (Streamlit)  
- Scaled input data using `StandardScaler`  
- Saved trained model (`joblib`) for deployment  
- Clean modular project structure
